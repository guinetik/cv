\par{
I'm an eclectic coder with an agnostic view of software engineering. I have over 10 years of experience coding for advertising, banking, public health and HR spaces. I do mostly software architecture focused on application development for the web, Tech Lead for agile squads, recruitment, on boarding, training and mentorship of new developers. 
I'm a fast prototyper, command line geek and I believe that coding is the ultimate form of expression.
