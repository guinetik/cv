\par{
Eclectic coder with an agnostic view of software engineering: my strength is adapting to whatever technology best solves the problem. 10+ years building systems across advertising, banking, public health, and fintech. I build foundational software, lead agile teams and mentor developers. Fast prototyper, command line enthusiast, and believer that code is the ultimate form of expression.
